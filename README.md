# Super-Mario-63 (in Godot)

Super Mario 63 is a fangame from 2009 developed by Runouw.

This project has been converted from Adobe Flash CS6 Uncompressed XFL format (xml files) into Godot scenes via a converter written in GDScript. Currently no code has been ported and in many places, the graphics has not been correctly converted.

## Compatible Development Applications

* Godot Engine 4.0.3 (tested). Should work on newer versions as well.

## Source audio files

These are missing from the project files.

## How to run the converter

Run the scene in `res://tests/mass_convert/mass_convert.tscn`. This will take a few minutes, but should convert everything in `res://sm63/LIBRARY` and place `.tscn` tiles into `res://sm63_godot`
